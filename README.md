    <b>Unused file finder: </b> Because there are so many files to manage, I created a tool for finding unused files in this repository by recursively searching folders and checking which files link to each other. The code for this is titled 'check_for_unused_files.py' in this repository and has been open sourced in a separate repository linked <a href="https://github.com/zroe1/findUnusedFilesHTML">here</a> with further information.
